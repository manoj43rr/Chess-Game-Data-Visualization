# Chess-Game-Data-Visualization
Chess Game Data Visualization using Python

This is one of my favorite projects i worked on, the dataset was prepared by me. I used ChatGPT to implement this project. There are two major applications 1) Game Visualization 2) Data Visualization. In the first phase we need to specify the moves played by two players then the program would generate chess board with the moves provided. In the second phase the program uses the dataset to generate 5 different graphs providing deeper information about the game.

once you have downloaded and extracted the zip file

create two new folders and rename as below:

**> chess_moves**

**> chess_moves_png**

now you are all set to start the program follow the below steps:

**1 open the .txt file in the folder and copy the entire thing in the file**

**2 then open the command prompt from the same directory then write down the below command**

# streamlit run z.py

**3 In the input field paste the text you copied from the .txt file**

you will see the chess game visualization you can move to the next move using next button.

In the very left you would find a new option where you would the second option proceed by clicking it then submit the .csv file from the folder. you would find the Data visualizations for the .csv file you inserted.
